## Why

IOG Technical Intelligence assessed DeFiFormal against 13 formal-verification tools and semantic models for DeFi (ConCert, Act, Certora Prover/CVL, CFF, Kontrol, Lean AMM formalization, Marlowe Isabelle semantics, Maude-LP, MEV-formal, Move Prover, Scribble, Solidity SMTChecker, Verity) on capability, performance and maturity. DeFiFormal was benchmarked on the same two workloads on 2026-11-06 and its capabilities were graded from this repository at `2b60322cdc8c98f0e0c27cab3b2d6dcc824c3eda` (branch `semantic-kernel-pivot`). The report is `docs/research/competitive-landscape-2026-11/defiformal-competition-tech-strategy.html`.

Three findings motivate this change:

- The field has solved accounting: 10 of 13 tools have supported, scoped token-conservation findings. Checked composition remains open: no tool has a supported unit-consistency or interface-compatibility cell, and invariant composition is shared only by ConCert. Economic safety has scoped proofs (MEV-formal's ordering safety is the only supported economic cell among competitors), but broader guarantees remain unestablished in the assessed artifacts. DeFiFormal is rated supported on asset units, component interfaces and composition, and already holds the mechanisms for both: dimensioned types, composition contracts with preservation theorems, and four execution modes.
- On the benchmark DeFiFormal lands in the proof-assistant band with Act, ConCert and Verity: all four Suite 1.0 cases established, none without guidance, replay 2.4 to 3.9 s, and the sixteen-transfer case costing the same as the four-transfer case. DeFiFormal and Act are the only tools that establish the whole rational-1 suite, and DeFiFormal proves the seven executor-level cases on its own kernel library, the first measurement in the suite to establish those cases on existing code rather than a benchmark model. Its weak side is the two single-step cases: the transfer needed a separate record and the swap needed a new model, because the kernel has no swap operation, and it did not pass the automatic stage that Act and CFF passed.
- Documentation that reproduces is the column that decides whether a tool can be depended on, and activity does not predict it: reproduction failed for 3 of 13 projects (ConCert, Marlowe Isabelle semantics, Verity), including the two most active Lean and Rocq peers. DeFiFormal was not assessed under the maturity rubric; read under its four headings, its repository is green on activity, tests and documentation and blank on CI, release, outside reproduction and known adoption.

## What Changes

- Add one planning slice with 24 tasks in four phases that close five gaps identified by the assessment:
  - D1, no composition across two real financial components: no contract instance that two components share, no lemma invoked by both;
  - D2, arithmetic correspondence covers one operation at one fixed value: no proof that an executable operation and its exact-rational transition agree over the full domain, with rounding, fees and refusal;
  - D3, no stated relation between the Lean model and the pinned deployed code: quantified correspondence and source refinement are open;
  - D4, no adversary or environment model: schedules are inputs, there is no notion of permitted moves, capital, prices or inclusion;
  - D5, no evidence package re-checked by anyone outside the project: no CI, no release, no outside reproduction. Suite 1.0 now records independent leanchecker timings; outside reproduction remains open.
- Phase I is operational. Phase II targets the first composed financial example subject to its financial connection and preservation requirements. Phase III measures it against the field. Phase IV widens the financial scope. Adapter-dependent tasks in every phase require the corresponding pinned artifacts or specified replacements to be available.
- Record for every task its kind and what it serves, as the report does. The report ties tasks to the program at four points only (sprint P18 in I.4, sprint P27 in IV.3, and sprints P16 and P19 in the closing of gaps D3 and D5); any further sprint mapping is proposed in design.md and is this change's, not the report's. The frozen 37-sprint program, its sprint plan and `openspec/specs/` main specs are not edited.
- Keep every planning gate open until independent review of these exact bytes. No task is ticked, no Lean, CI configuration or adapter code is included.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `benchmark-regression-gate`: CI that runs the build, the axiom audit and the Suite 1.0 and rational-1 adapters on every commit and fails on a lost case, replay growth above 1.1×, a benchmark build over 15 s, or a changed proof-module checksum.
- `composed-financial-workflow`: the sUSDS deposit and the token0 quote register under one `ComponentContract` with an explicit financial connection and initialization/preservation proved for actual execution, invoking one shared financial lemma, with units, refusal and the second instance's authored lines checked. Without that connection, only narrower reuse is claimed and composition remains open.
- `arithmetic-correspondence-contracts`: per-operation correspondence between the executable Word-arithmetic operation and its exact-rational transition over the full domain, including rounding, fees and refusal.
- `economic-obligations`: solvency, price-integrity and ordering obligations stated as separate theorems with explicit premises on the existing borrow and oracle guards.
- `reproducible-evidence-package`: compiled proof modules shipped with checker name and version, trusted-import list, check scope and checksums; a documented pinned-cache setup timed from clone to passing replay; an outside reproduction on record.
- `financial-scope`: an AMM swap operation, an ordering scenario on the interleaving executor, liquidation, and lending beyond borrow.

### Modified Capabilities

None in `openspec/specs/`. Where a task extends an accepted capability (for example P17 platform reuse or P19 certificates), the extension is stated as a delta in this change only.

## Impact

Planning files live under `openspec/changes/competitive-landscape-adoption/`. The report and its README live under `docs/research/competitive-landscape-2026-11/`. No existing file is modified. The measurement records behind the report are retained in IOG's assessment repository (`input-output-hk/SOTA-DeFiFormal-Moriarty`), which is private; `evidence-index.json` names them and the report embeds every number. The Suite 1.0 and rational-1 adapters used to measure DeFiFormal are IOG-authored and are not part of this change; all tasks using their adapters, proofs or helpers require the corresponding pinned artifacts or specified replacements to be available, and their contribution is a separate decision for the repository owner.
